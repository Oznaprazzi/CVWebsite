						<h2>Skills</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
							<p>Programming</p>
							I learnt how to program in Python, HTML and PHP during high school. I also designed websites not only using HTML but also PHP.
							</li>
							</br>
							<li>
							<p>Team work</p>
							I did a lot of team work practice during a group project called the Autonomous Vehicle Challenge, in an engineering course. The goal of this project was to develop an autonomous vehicle with much communication between each member in the team in order to create a successful outcome. 
							</li>
							</br>
							<li>
							<p>Leadership and communication skills</p>
							I have been a class representative for every one of my courses at Victoria University. I aim to build on my leadership and communication skills by talking to students and getting feedback from them about the courses. As a class representative, it is my job to offer guidance, provide support and resolve problems that students may have. I also have the responsible to make sure that students who are having problems or trouble with the course are getting as much help as possible from tutors or the lecturer.
							</li>
						</ol>
						
						<h2>Work Experience</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
							<p>Intern at Datacom</p>
							I worked with Datacom for a few months as an intern before I graduated. They trained me to test software they were developing which widened my knowledge about testing software.
							</li>
							</br>
							<li>
							<p>Intern at Google</p>
							I also worked with Google as a software developer intern before I graduated. I learnt to build data structures and algorithms and expanded on my own personal knowledge about these topics.
							</li>
							</br>
							<li>
							<p>Programming tutor</p>
							I helped students who had trouble doing assignments. I had to explain programming concepts to them by drawing out and giving them examples so that they could visually understand what I was explaining. I developed communication and teaching skills from this, which helped me build confidence and courage.
							</li>
							</br>
							<li>
							<p>Outreach(CS4HS Program)</p>
							I helped out in the outreach programme in 2015. This programme was made to help teachers from different high schools learn about the subjects associated with the engineering degree. My job was to help them out with understanding the concepts taught by the lecturers.
